I am a computer scientist specializing in applied cryptography, elliptic curve cryptography, and Android development. 

I recently graduated from [Graz University of Technology](https://tugraz.at), where I finished my master thesis on a privacy-friendly payment scheme in cooperation with Infineon Technologies.

# Theses

## Master Thesis - "Privacy-friendly Payment Scheme from Group Signatures" -  [PDF](master_thesis.pdf)

I implemented a group signature scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography in Java. Using this group signature implementation, I created a privacy-friendly payment scheme.  It consists of two Android apps and a backend, emulating similar functionality as other existing NFC-based payment schemes.

## Bachelor Thesis - "Cache.pdf: Cache Covert Channels using JavaScript" - [PDF](bachelor_thesis.pdf)

I created a covert channel from a PDF file to a website by embedding JavaScript inside a PDF and measuring CPU cache latency from a script running inside a web browser. This thesis was supervised by [Moritz Lipp](https://mlq.me/).
